\chapter{Controlling the system}
Here Casper you can write some ideas and possibilities for the control design.
Also add the pwm we have here, the possibility to dynamically change duty cycle, 
Mention in detail what a good uTosNet interface have we created.

Make as much as possible, every page counts :) Don't forget pics.

Cheers!
